## Improving The Bot
To improve the bot you must 

add a Pattern and Intent to the patterns.json file in the patterns folder 
```
    {
      "pattern": "Pattern_added_with_regular_expression_format_or_with_xregexp_format",
      "intent": "Intent"
    },
```

you also must  add a case to handle the new intent in the app.js file
```
case 'Intent':
  res.send({
      msg: `message you want to send`
    });
  break;
```
